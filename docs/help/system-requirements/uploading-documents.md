# Uploading Documents

:::tip
Documents must be in **.pdf** format. 
:::

For instructions on how to convert your document to PDF see the [Adobe Website](https://new.acrobat.com/en_us/products/pdf-pack.html?s_tnt=67837:1:0). 

When uploading documents you must ensure that you are uploading the document itself and not the document’s path.

---

## To do so (must be done in Internet Explorer):


1. While on the FERNS homepage click the gear icon in the upper right hand corner
   of your screen.

2. Click on Internet Options from the drop down menu that appears.
